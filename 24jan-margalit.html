				<h4> Projects at the Greenhouse </h4>

				<p> Sometimes it feels like because we have so much going on outside of the greenhouse (random physics lectures, the Idan Center, traveling), that we don't get enough time to spend at the Greenhouse. But on the three days a week we are at the greenhouse, we lead some pretty cool projects! </p>

				<p> On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we teach two groups of relatively good English speakers in a class called "MIT Schooling". These students are 9th and 10th graders from the local schools Gvanim and Mevoot Eron. Each of us is reading an English science article with the students, and then conducting some research on the topic and preparing a presentation. In my group, we are reading an article about 3D printing organs, an exciting process that has recently developed but still has a while to go until we can transplant these organs. My students are making a poster and a skit about someone who needs an organ transplant. The skit will discuss some of the challenges of 3D printing biological materials. A lot of the students here have already used 3D printers many times at the Greenhouse, which makes explaining these new technologies a lot easier. At the Idan Center, where we have also taught this article, most of the students have never seen a 3D printer because they live in a more remote area.</p>

				<p> Meia is teaching an article on creating biofuel from Algae, which is particularly relevant to the Greenhouse because of the massive amounts of Algae they have. Many kids run experiments to find ideal conditions for growing algae. In fact, one group of particularly driven students have been growing Spirulina to feed to chicks! This strand of algae is a particularly nutritious "superfood". Currently, no projects in this greenhouse actually produce biodiesel from algae, but the greenhouse staff are very interested in doing so. One of the biggest challenges to doing this is environmentally, safely, and efficiently separating the lipids from the rest of the algae. A few weeks ago, a Columbia student visiting the greenhouse on a Birthright tour shared some of her ideas on this from a system she had developed at home to produce biofuel. Her system uses and Ultrasonic frequency generator to separate the parts of the algae. Perhaps this is a project the Greenhouse will explore at some point - some think it is the energy of the future!</p>

				<p> Nikhil is teaching an article about why global warming may not be dangerous. A very thought provoking topics! Emmanuel is teaching an article on the Paris Climate talks, and plans to bring clean energy to Africa. This weekend, we stayed at the home of Yosef Abromowitz, a pioneer in solar energy. We met him right after he returned from an initiative in Zimbabwe to bring Solar fields and power to Africa. We learned from him that the technology today can produce solar energy far more cheaply than fossils fuels, but the major impediment is lobbyists and political issues. It was amazing to see someone actually working on precisely what this article expressed hope of! </p>

				<p> Our main projects at the greenhouse are the AgroPioneers workshops on Wednesday afternoons. My project is building a model of a 3-bit full adder using water, instead of electricity. Essentially, this projects uses water to add two numbers up to seven. The first week, we taught the students binary, and built a system to convert decimal numbers to binary. The next week, we explained logic gates, and built the necessary gates to add two binary numbers. This past week, we worked on a mechanism to convert the binary result back into decimal. Our goal is to accomplish this using a sort of spring scale, though we still have some work to do! Since our logic gates are not quite perfect yet (they rely on two streams of water intersecting in precisely the right place), we sometimes get funky results like 3+6 = 6. (If you know binary, you will know why that is especially concerning!) I'm glad transistors in computers operate more reliably. One of my students, Inbar, has already decided that his next project will be building a 2-bit multiplier!

				<p> Emmanuel's Agro-Pioneer project is using a the mechanical power from pedaling a bicycle to charge a phone. As of now, his group has turned an old bike into a stationary bike, and developed a system to charge the phone. Their next goal is to use an Arduino to light up LEDs corresponding to how much power the person pedaling is producing! </p>

				<p> Meia and Nikhil are working with students to build a hydroponic system suitable for someone's home. Their project has several components, including a homemade water filter so that the system can use recycled water from washing machines or other sources. Indeed, filtration systems like these are one of the main ways Israel has managed its water shortage. (The other two main ways are desalination and underground aquifers. California, take note! For those of you who still thought Israel's water was coming from the Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee), not too much is anymore.) </p>

				<p> Thats all for now!</p>
