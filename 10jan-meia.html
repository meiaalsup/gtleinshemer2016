				<h4> Israel: The Startup Nation </h4>

				<p> <em> 6:45am. I wake to my unfriendly alarm for the first time since coming to Israel. But no time to waste, this morning we have an important meeting with Gideon Yadin, CEO of GevaSol, and funder of the GTL Israel greenhouse program - aka us. Pressure is on to make sure he knows his donation was worthwhile. Margalit and I grab a few bites to eat, throw on our MIT swag for the MISTI Instagram contest, and hustle out of our apartment to our waiting van. </em> </p>

				<p> Today we traveled to the GevaSol's Idan Center office in northern Israel to meet with Gideon. Gideon was extremely friendly, wore a smile, and excitedly shared his entrepreneurship story. Essentially, he grew up in a kibbutz in north-west Israel, served in the army, and then went back to work in the kibbutz's industry: <a href="images/solenoidvalve.jpg" target="_blank">solenoid valves</a>. However, as a young man full of ambition, this work was insufficient for Gideon. He left the kibbutz and moved to Amsterdam with his girlfriend (and now wife!) to start <a href="http://www.gevasol.com/" target="_blank">GevaSol</a>. </p>

				<p> GevaSol's business model is to capitalize on situations where standard catalog solenoid valves do not meet manufacturers' needs through customization. Essentially, Gideon meets with manufacturers needing custom valves, chooses which projects to take on, and then hands the projects to his engineers to tackle. The company places large emphasis on finding the "right" people and employees. Gideon hires largely based on intuition, choosing teams that can work with a large amount of self-autonomy and problem-solve to create novel models and solutions. Gideon describes that this core value of people is very important to GevaSol, especially as the business is a family business. </p>

				<p> After sharing his story of rising from nothing to becoming CEO of a 70 million euro multinational company, we had the opportunity to ask Gideon a few questions. A few of the most thought-provoking responses follow (paraphrased / summarized based on my memory).</p>

				<!-- some way to show interiew -->
				<div class="vertline">

				<div class="interview"> 

				<p class="question"> What do you think an entrepreneur needs to get started? </p>

				<p> <em> Drive. Passion. An industrialist mindset. I started GevaSol by literally moving to Holland and sending emails to find customers for my idea. If you want to get started, you just have to do it. I did not have anything when I began: no investors, no money except a little I had saved from the army, no mentors, no college education, and no guidance. Too often, people get too caught up in the details. Do not wait around for opportunities, take your idea, believe in it, and go for it. </em> <p>


				<p class="question"> What kind of planning do you recommend for startups? </p>
				<p> <em> No need for a business plan. I know this might sound surprising to you because in America there is a large emphasis on writing a solid business plan. However, I did not plan ahead when I started GevaSol in Amsterdam. I had an idea, convined manufacturers to give me a chance, and did not look back. There was no way for me to predict how each potential customer would respond to my pitch, nor predict how the overall market would fluctuate over time. When manufacturers fell out with their current valve suppliers, I would seize the opportunity to sell them on GevaSol. But it would be impossible to predict when such opportunities would arise. Further, when the market fell in 2008, the need for custom valves increased and design requests for Gevasol skyrocketed. We adapted as best we could, but could not take on every project that we would have liked to. We are constantly adjusting our strategies in response to current market conditions and factors. The market is volatile, and writing a business plan that attempts to account for every possible situation is impractical.  </em> <p>

				<p class="question"> Are you involved in the engineering process of the valves? </p>

				<p> <em> In short, no. I tried to learn the physics and engineering side, but it was difficult, and I decided also not worth it. In fact, I think it is better that I do not understand the underlying engineering. For example, in the company's early years, I met with one potential customer who described a specific need. I immediately proclaimed that of course my engineers could build a valve to solve this issue. When I returned back to describe the task to my engineering team, they looked at me and said it was impossible. Yet, a few months later, they found a solution and developed a working prototype. Had I known a thing or two about engineering during the initial meeting with the customer, I probably would have told them the task was not possible and lost this opportunity not only for a business relationship, but also for innovation. In fact, one of the best strategies for innovation is to bring in individuals who are not experts in the field in as consults. Often times, in school and in work, individuals are "funneled" into a certain mindset with a certain toolkit at their disposal. It can be difficult to see solutions to problems outside of this common set of problem solving techniques taught to a certain profession. When you bring in people not from a particular specialty, they come in with fresh eyes, different perspectives, and creative ideas. </em> </p>

				<p class="question"> How often does GevaSol successfully create the custom products they promise? What happens if they do not? </p>

				<p> <em> We are successful about 60%-70% of the time. If we are unsuccessful, whether we continue business with the customer in question depends largely on our previous relationship and how understanding they are. In the United States, you have one shot. If you make a mistake and do not deliver, that is it, the customer will find a different supplier. However, in other European and Middle Eastern countries, we find customers much more understanding. If we are late or fail to create satisfactory valves, we can usually explain the situation, ask for more time for our research and development, and generally talk our way out of missed deadlines. </em> </p>

				<p> Our conversation with Gideon was very eye-opening and revealed a completely different approach to entrepreneurship and business management than I had ever been exposed to previously. I appreciated the comparison of expectations of business in the United States versus elsewhere. Overall, I really enjoyed this talk - this is definitely a highlight of our time in Israel thus far. Apparently he enjoyed our meeting too - Gideon wants to fund another MISTI program this summer to bring eight MIT students to Israel! We somehow managed to impress him?! Huge sigh of relief. </p>

				<p>After our meeting with Gideon, our Idan center hosts took us to tour Golan Heights. <figure> <img src="images/golan/4.jpg" alt="Team of Four at Golan Heights" class="img-responsive"> <figcaption> Team of four at Golan Heights</figcaption> </figure>  From this vista point we could look out towards Syria, snow-covered mountains, and the farms of several nearby kibbutzim. Check out our <a href="gallery.html" target="_blank">gallery</a> for more awesome shots. Atop this mountain we also explored an Israeli war bunker with lookouts towards Syria. Our phones became useful once again for a purpose other than photos: flashlights! Walking through these dark, damp tunnels I was immediately glad I had chosen to wear rainboots. The tunnels were a huge maze and I am glad I did not have to navigate them alone. </p>

				<p> Post Golan Heights we toured one of GevaSol's factories: Bental. I was pleasantly surprised by the facility's aesthetics. I realized that school and the media had skewed my perception of factories because the only factories I had ever heard about or seen pictures of were in the context of exposes on bad working conditions. However, many modern factories are not like this at all - the good ones just <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140728-why-is-all-the-news-bad" target="_blank">never make the news</a>. Since GevaSol only deals with customized parts, their factory consists of primarily workspaces for assembly by humans with machines as supplements and aids. We talked to a few of the people who were busying away at their stations, and they were all eager and proud to explain their work to us. Further, many of their workspaces were decorated with family photos on the walls, and potted plants smiled from every unused space. No one I have ever met has proclaimed their dream job to be in a factory; however, it seems this might be due to common misconceptions about what factories are actually like. </p>
