				<h4>On Arrival</h4>

				

				<p>The past 35 hours have been an adventure. I mean I expected an adventure, I am traveling to Israel after all... but this adventrure was different. Essentially, I arrived for my layover in Istanbul, Turkey, expecting to be on my way to Tel Aviv in 2 hours. But low and behold snow mounted outside and 10,000 travelers, including me, were stranded in the airport. </p>

				<p> The airline set all of the Tel Aviv bound passengers up together in a hotel close to the airport and the group of about 40 of us ended up spending 15 hours together. Huddling to keep warm from the cold air as we waited for our bus, we bonded over our common enemy: Turkish Airlines. After scrambling to obtain Turkish visas and tasting the local Turkish food the airline brought us, we eventually got a couple hours of sleep at the hotel. By the time we were boarding our flight to Israel the next day, we had become a family - thank goodness they all spoke English! </p>

				<p> Most of the other travelers were Israelis returning home from vacations to spend the New Year abroad, and I heard story after story of adventures in cities all over the world including Barcelona, Amsterdam, and New York. Many of them also asked why I was traveling to Israel. I described that MIT has a program to go abroad and teach during January, and that I am part of a team of four students who will be teaching at the greenhouse in Kibbutz Ein Shemer. An elderly couple I spoke with generously offered to share their home with our team if we visit on a weekend. They live on the beach just south of Tel Aviv - I hope we take them up on this kind offer! </p>

				<p> Everyone I talked to had different advice and their own two cents on what to expect, but they were all united in the sentiment that I was going to have a phenomenal experience! "That kibbutz is the best, very collaborative." "Everyone is so welcoming!" "January is rainy, I hope you brought a raincoat to go exploring in." "The food there is wonderful and fresh from the garden." Leaving America was a little scary to say the least (I haven't been abroad in 6 years), so I was pretty nervous going in. But meeting all these friendly individuals who were so enthusiastic about Ein Shemer, definitely helped not only to ease my nerves, but also to excite me even more for my month here!  </p>

				<p> While my memories of these 15 hours are blurry due to jet lag, I will not forget meeting and bonding with way more people than whose names I could possibly remember. Even though the experience was a little stressful, I am glad I got to know all these individuals and share in small snippets of their lives before beginning my own adventure (part two?) in Israel. Super stoked for the next month - I cannot imagine a better way to spend IAP! </p>

				<p> With wide eyes and a smile, Yalla! (Hebrew - actually Arabic - for "Let's go!") <br>
