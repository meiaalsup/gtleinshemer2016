				<h4>The first few days at the Greenhouse</h4>

				<p>The four of us arrived at Ein Shemer on Sunday. We first got lunch at the Chadar Ochel, the dining room that used to be completely communal before the Kibbutz became privatized, but still remains a lunch cafeteria for Kibbutznicks and kids at nearby schools. After that, we met with some of the Greenhouse staff to discuss our plans for projects with the kids.</p>

				<p>One of our main projects is an afterschool program every Wednesday at the Greenhouse (Hamama) with the kids from nearby schools. Each of us is doing a different project with the kids.</p>

				<p> My project is building a simulation of a full adder using water (the component of a computer that adds binary numbers). I will be responsible for this project, along with another Israeli working at the Kibbutz. The other projects are building a cell phone charger powered by the mechanical energy from a bike and building hydroponic systems. Our first meeting with the kids is on Wednesday. </p>

				<p> The entire greenhouse staff is extremely welcoming. The greenhouse was founded in 1976 by Avital Geva, and is now a non-profit that runs many classes and afterschool activities for kids at neighboring schools. Avital Geva always makes us lots of tea and food in the kitchen of the greenhouse whenever he is around. His sons, Noam and Atar, are coordinating this MIT program. Every night, we buy food from the convenient store at the Kibbutz, and cook dinner in the kitchen at the greenhouse. Last night we made homemade Pizza in a Pita oven! </p> 

				<p> Today the four of us went to the Idan Center, another technological/educational center in Emek HaMaayonot. The Idan Center was founded recently in an effort to engage kids from nearby Kibbutzim - both religious and secular - and kids from Jordan, in technology products. They do lots of 3D printing, mechanical engineering and robotics. I think part of the motivation is to keep families in this area instead of moving to bigger cities. </p>

				<p> In the morning, we presented English tech articles to small groups of 9th graders. Knowing hebrew was very helpful, and I learned a lot of semi-technical terms from the kids, too. The Idan center staff made us an incredible three course lunch, and then in the afternoon, I worked on building a cellphone/light charger powered by a bike. Today was purely theoretical - we went over the design and calculated how big we need to make certain components to get enough voltage. Lots of physics equations! We will getting into the mechanics next week, but I already learned a lot about the mechanics components they use here - for example, bearings, and 3D printed objects. </p>
