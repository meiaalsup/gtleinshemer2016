				<h4> Spontaneity and Physics </h4>

				<p> Are you ready? </p>

				<p> Many Americans enjoy being spontaneous. They like it when they see ice cream and impulsively purchase. They relish drinking adventures that arise on the spur of the moment from random conversations about frat parties. Well, that's one kind of spontaneity. That is a kind which involves less thinking and involves just doing what comes to mind in the moment. The Israeli concept of spontaneity is quiet different; at least for this particular occasion. </p>

				<p>

				During our first Agro-Pioneers (project based class) meeting, one of the students, Omri, expressed his appreciation of our presence. Omri told us that he arranged with his teacher to spare an entire physics class just for us (the MIT students) to talk about ourselves. This request was amid several others, which included supervising classes that weren't on our schedule and planning for projects that we didn't know of. Being the MIT students we are, we gladly accepted Omri's request. </p>

				<p>

				Almost reminiscent of the typical MIT week, the fateful Thursday sneaked upon us. </p>

				<p>

				To set the scene: </p>

				<p>

				Meia was thinking about how to use her knowledge from her physics class to explain the demo she will be presenting. Margalit had acquired the rim of a bicycle from my Agro-pioneers project. She spun the rim fervently and then holding on to the hub, fiercely turned the wheel left and right, almost as if to confirm that the physics was still correct. Nikhil was trying to rid the day's topic of the curse of knowledge. He was very convinced that we should carry out our demos and explained them, without using any differential equations (which are central to a true understading of the demo). I did side with him on this intent though - afterall, the students were tenth graders. Margalit and Nikhil were presenting one project and Meia and I were presenting another. The demo Meia and I were presenting was slightly harder to grasp because it showed the essense of the saying that "With gyros, intuition might not serve you well". I was all the while, thinking of a way to easily explain my part of the presentation without giving our students the wrong concepts. I was explaining to Meia how the direction of the torque lies on the axis about which the object is rotating, and that this explanation might be easier to understand. Three students entered the greenhouse and I exclaimed (in a controlled manner), "Crap!, we're not done.", but we headed out with them anyway. </p>

				<p>

				The walk: </p>

				<p>

				As we treaded the old tarred road leading to Mevo'ot High School, the three students demonstrated the all too well known pointed questions asked by Israelis. They brought up the topic of MIT admissions and financial aid. Well of course, we didn't mind talking about such issues. We openly talked about MIT's need blind admissions. One of the studensts asked, "So is the $40,000 cost for the entire four years?". We frankly responded "No, the cost of an MIT education for a year is about $60,000". Naturally, they screamed in surprise, "That's so expensive!". Then they asked, "So how much are you guys paying?" To the American, this question isn't likely to be asked even after the second or the third or the hundredth day after making someoneâ€™s acquaintance. We explained that some MIT students receive some amount of aid from MIT and some pay full tuition, obviously swerving their question. We soon got to the high school. </p>

				<p>

				The school: </p>

				<p>

				The high school campus was pretty similar to the American high schools I have seen in movies (given that I haven't been in one myself). The girls dressed like Americans: tight pants, leggings, shorts, etc. I must say, I was expecting the contrary but probably because I was uninformed about the Israeli culture. I was expecting people in the middle east to be less flashy in their appearance but the girls wore make up to school. As Nikhil would put it, "Everyone in the world wants to be an American". They had benches outside their classrooms, just as some high schools in the warmer parts of the US have. Students gathered based on certain characters that made them feel more at home with each other - flashy girls with flashy girls and guys who enjoy the "thug life", with kindred minds. Congregating based on similar interests is a human instinct anyway, but the thing is, the school just felt like an American one. </p>

				<p>

				In the classroom: </p>

				<p>

				When we got into the classroom, we greeted the teacher and took notice of our audience - a group of passionate high-schoolers who were ready to see what substance MIT students are made of. We began by introducing ourselves - where we're from, our respective years in college, our majors, etc. Then we got to the demo. Margalit began by asking for a volunteer from the students. One of the student came forward and held the bicycle tire. Margalit told him to turn it sideways and asked, "Is it difficult to turn?" and he said it wasn't. Then Margalit spun the rim such that it's rotation caused a small breeze. Then she asked the student to try turning it to the sides and asked, "Is it still easy to turn or harder?". The student responded, "Harrder" (I assumed he was an Arabic speaker because Hebrew speakers don't roll their "r"). His response got some of the students giggling but one could still tell that they were hardly convinced of the phenomenon being presented. Margalit therefore, called for a second volunteer and he confirmed that it was indeed harder to turn the rim when it's spinning. Nikhil successfully describes how an applied force on the top of the rim quickly spins to the bottom of the rim, which in turn pushes the rim as to maintain the original orientation. Our demo was different but still with the rim. Meia called for a volunteer to hold a string attached to the rim and we spun it. Upon releasing the rim but still holding unto the string vertically, the wheel begun to rotate around the axis of the string and spin at the same time (precession). I explained the basic concept of torque and the right hand rule and Meia explained the concept of conservation of angular momentum. We attempted to explain the precession of a gyro without using differentials.

				We explained that the torque prduced by the body's weight about the pivot, caused a change in the angular momentum vector which appears as precession. Technically, we used the concept of change over time, but not writing the tedious equations somehow made the students appear to understand our explanations. One noteworthy point is that, the school used smarts boards - inventions that aren't yet popular in MIT. If you encounter these for the first time, don't try erasing a mark with a regular eraser! Afterwards, we talked about the research projects we were working on. Meia talked about her data analysis project on medical samples, and Nikhil talked about his UROP project in neuroscience which dealt with the attempt to help people with almost dead brain cells to still control their limbs. I talked about my online textbook project that attempts to allow multiple users to run computationally intensive simulations using virtual machines and Margalit talked about her math research on continued fractions behaviors. The students then asked about what we did to get into MIT. We answered with the regulars - personal essays, teacher and counselor recommendations, extracurricular activities (including competitions, volunteer activities and clubs/associations and leadership positions). And of course the SATs. </p>

				<p>

				Conclusion: </p>

				<p>

				All's well that ends well. </p>

				<p>

				The moral: </p>

				<p>

				Ask the question on thy mind and be ever ready! </p>
