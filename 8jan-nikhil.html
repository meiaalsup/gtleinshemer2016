				<h4> Adventures in Tel Aviv </h4>

				<p> After struggling for several minutes to position our boat, Meia somehow managed to throw the rope around the wooden post, and we successfully docked. It was a small, artificial island in the middle of the small, artificial lake in Hayarkon Park, Tel Aviv. Upon disembarking, we dispersed. I walked slowly among the plants, finding a nice place by the water to sit down. The sights slowly poured in: the gentle lapping of the waves, the light blue sky, the children laughing in the other boats. It was quite peaceful. </p>

				<p> In this contemplative state, I decided to see what the others were doing. Meia was on the grass, legs pushed into an almost full split, already halfway through her stretches. Emmanuel was twenty feet away, oblivious to everything, marking a dance routine for his African dance group at MIT. It was fairly amusing, seeing how all of our personalities manifested themselves through our behaviors. </p>

				<p>This incident was one of many on the Tel Aviv excursion that allowed us to become more familiar with each other. After arriving late on Thursday night and meeting our gracious AirBnB host Dudi, we decided to check out a nearby club on Ibn Gabirol Street in the heart of Tel Aviv. The underground dance floor had a grimy feel, with graffiti lining the walls, multicolored strobe lights assaulting our irises, and the heavy bass of Kanye West and Dizzee Rascal reverberating amongst the reveling partygoers. We quickly realized that this wasn't our scene and ducked out within an hour, although it was definitely memorable. </p>

				<p> The next day we took a 14 mile walk all across southern Tel Aviv, taking in as many sights as possible. Jaffa, the world's oldest seaport; Florentin, the world's apparently second hippest neighborhood; Neve Tzedek, a community peppered with local cuisine and art galleries; Carmel Market, an infinite corridor's worth of sounds and smells.

				Realizing that we were still little children at heart, we leaped onto a playground near the coast, and accidentally terrorized some four year olds and their parents. Afterwards we went to get lunch in Neve Tzedek. While I picked my way through an excellent meal of kubbe (balls of beef wrapped in bulgur wheat) over okra, Meia joked over the fact that Emmanuel and I ate so slowly. Not caring in the slightest, I leaned back in my chair with a strong case of the itis (see the corresponding episode of the Boondocks for an explanation of this term). By the day's end, we were so exhausted that we crashed at 10 pm and realized that we were becoming old people. </p> 

				<p> On Saturday, we once again embarked on a long trek, this time only 11 miles and in the northern half of the city. This resulted in the Hayarkon Park adventure, where we rented out a boat for an hour after walking amongst the trees and much more health conscious Israelis. We tried to check out Tel Aviv University, but the gates were all locked, so we settled on getting lunch at a local restaurant instead. We discussed life over kabobs and hummus, vocalizing our ambitions and thoughts about the benefits and stresses of life at MIT. This talk (and eating, to Meia's amusement, and for which I still didn't and don't care) ended up going on for so long that the clock struck four. Remembering that the sun was going to set in 45 minutes with a start, we decided that we still wanted to see the sunset on the beach and got up in a hurry. We weren't going to make it in time, and Meia, our resident self-declared health nut, declared that we were going to need to run. As the contemplative cultured one in the group, all I wanted to do was appreciate the scenery of expensive high rise condominiums; capitalism at its finest! Instead, I found myself panting heavily, my temporal rate of swearing increasing at an exponential rate. But I ran anyway. We reached the pier in time for the sunset, which was, ironically enough, obscured by a cloud. Meia still claims that it was worth it. I decline comment on this issue. </p> 

				<p> We ended the evening by grabbing some tasty shawarma before taking the train to Binyamina and catching a ride back to the kibbutz. It was a crazy weekend where we learned a lot about the city and even more about each other. As a group that had barely knew each other prior to IAP, we were now uncomfortably used to each other in the best (?) of ways. I can only hope that our next two weekends prove to be as entertaining. </p>
