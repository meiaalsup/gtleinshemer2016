				<p>Shalom Lekoulam! Or alternatively, Hi Everyone! </p>
			<p> We are a team of four students at MIT who are spending our January Independent Activities Period in Kibbutz Ein Shemer, Israel, teaching high school! We will be utlizing the community greenhouse to perform science experiments, teaching English via science articles, building aeroponic and hydroponic farming systems, modeling computational thinking with mechanical bit-adder systems, and exploring Israel in our free time. We are very excited and hope you will follow our adventures as we share and post about them here!</p>
			<p>Sincerely, <br />
				Margalit, Nikhil, Emmanuel, Meia</p> 
			<p>PS: Questions, Comments, Concerns, Inquiries? Feel free to shoot us an <a href="mailto:einshemer2016@mit.edu">email</a>!

					Emmanuel is a second year student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He always proudly says heâ€™s from Ghana before mentioning his school (probably just so people know where he derives his accent). He is thinking of a concentration in Economics and has some interests in natural resource mining. In his spare time, he likes to watch TV shows, play foosball, ice skate (a recent development) and cook.

						Meia is a first-year at MIT currently planning to major in mathematics with computer science, minor in energy studies, and ultimately apply her studies to work towards clean energy solutions.

The greenhouse excites Meia very much because she loves plants, the outdoors, and working with children!

					Nikhil is a second year at MIT studying physics with a possible concentration in neuroscience. He is doing research in the materials science department on nanomedicines for the brain. He is originally from New Jersey and does not intend to go back. In his free time he enjoys singing a capella, writing stories, taking pictures, and armchair philosophizing with anybody who will listen.
