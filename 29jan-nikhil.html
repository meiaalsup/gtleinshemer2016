				<h6> Jan 29, 2016 </h6>
				<h4> Summary </h4>

				<p> The plane, operated by the Dutch airline KLM, turns gently to the left as it positions itself on the runway. A female voice speaking in Dutch, which to my untrained ears sounds like a less intense, more comical version of German, is presumably whining at us to put on our seatbelts and turn off our cell phones, or some other permutation of the usual nonsense. Paying the intercom no attention, I look past my seatmate out the window to see the early morning clouds of Tel Aviv one last time. It has been a rather surreal last four weeks, and as the plane slowly begins to pick up speed and a sentimental acoustic guitar harmony begins to play in the background, my brows crease and the scene cuts to a melodramatic, nonlinear montage of memories. </p>

				<p> Meia and I are laughing for the fifth time about how hard engineering is. Yasmin and I are having a casual conversation about the internal tensions present in our primitive brains that make human life so challenging at 2 in the morning. I'm riding the cable car as it swiftly ascends to the ruins of Masada. Two of my middle school students from Agro-Pioneers are teaching me bad Hebrew pickup lines. For the record, I did not end up using any of them. Margalit is hyperventilating in anticipation of the next stop on the train. Emmanuel and Meia are crying and/or laughing as the magnetic sensor on their Arduino continues to output binary nonsense. I am losing myself in the beauty of the Baha'i Gardens.

				<p> Dafna is turning me into a cat.

				<p> Lior is taking me slacklining, and I attempt to convey the difficulty I'm having with him in broken Spanish, our only common language. A boy from the West Bank is telling me gravely about some of the dark things he has seen during a case competition in Jerusalem. I'm at a networking event hearing about the exciting progress and synergy at MIT Sloan. Camille is introducing me to the kibbutz goats. A tiny one approaches me, and I am momentarily thrilled that it likes me. I discover that the goat only wants me for my pizza flavored pastry and I am rendered heartbroken. Meia and Margalit are giving me a hard time for eating slowly on [insert date in range(Jan 3, Jan 29)]. Meia, Emmanuel, and I are hit by a simultaneous sneak attack of itis (read: gastrointestinal distress) after a dangerously large meal of authentic Druze cuisine. Gil is helping me 3D print a custom key chain at the Idan Center. Emmanuel and I bond over reggae classics while basking in the warmth of the sacred room heater. Avital is thanking us profusely in broken English for our service to the greenhouse, and it is adorable. I'm playing catch with my favorite greenhouse dog, Mist. We're scrambling to tape the LED strips onto the hydroponic system before David Dolev's face appears on the projector during the final session. Emmanuel is cursing the city of Haifa for ever deciding that building on a hill was a good idea while we ascend staircase after staircase to find a hotel. Margalit attempts not to suffocate on her soup at the Idan Center, as the sight of Emmanuel's facial expressions robs her of control over her respiratory system. I am throwing a fit in the greenhouse kitchen because somebody has stolen my meat. We are bonding over the sappy romance of Before Sunrise. Atar is bringing me to the kibbutz from Binyamina, and Romi talks excitedly to me in Hebrew while I only wish I could understand. Wracked with jetlag, I wake up at 5 am and watch the sun rise over the kibbutz by myself. It is beautiful. </p>

				<p> The plane, not having had the courtesy to pause for a respectful moment of silence during my reverie, is now taking off. I sigh deeply as I peruse the aircraft's entertainment selections and decide to anesthetize myself with the Cohen brothers's great contribution to the world of stoner comedy, The Big Lebowski. I wish I could have stayed longer in Israel; talked to more people, learned more history, worked with more kids. But such is the nature of life. All good things must come to an end. And as I resign myself to another several months of keeping myself awake through tortuous lectures, I decide that it's not worth feeling sad about missing Israel; rather, I should instead focus on and cherish the fact that it happened.  </p>

				<p> It's just one of those things. </p>
