				<h4> Touring near Jerusalem </h4>

				<p> We woke up at 6:30 and walked for about 30 minutes in Jerusalem to catch the 7:15am tour bus. According to the tour company’s website, there were two stops for the bus but it never showed up at the second stop. Meia called the tour company and arranged the company arranged for a taxi to pick us up so that we could meet the bus at Masada. After waiting for another half hour, the taxi didn’t arrive so Meia called again. The tour company in an attempt to placate us sent one of their mini buses to pick us up… for the whole day… just us! It was amazing! </p>

				<p> We got ourselves a personal bus driver for Masada, Ein Gedi and the dead sea. Unlike some of the incredible drivers we had on previous trips, this driver didn’t speak much English so communication was a bit of a challenge. We soon reached the Masada mountain. Meia being her athletic self tried to convince Nikhil and I to hike up the mountain. But given the day's walking and hiking, Nikhil and I convinced her into taking a cable car! The ride up was quick and fun. There were a host of other tourists who had come from the U.S., and we had a nice chat with them. At the top of the mountain, we walked around looking at stones and rocks and desert sand. The antiquated structures made little sense to us since we didn’t know the history of the people who inhabited the mountain. Nikhil found some tourists, who had a tour guide and he notified us. We shamelessly joined in to listen to the intriguing history of Masada. From the tour guide’s explanation of how the Roman garrison besieged the Jewish freedom fighters, he mentioned a reference he had made earlier in their tours of a different city. We quickly realized the group had been together for a while and that they knew we were intruding. I must say, that intrusion was the best thing we could have done at Masada. <figure> <img src="images/masada.jpg" alt="Emmanuel at Masada" class="img-responsive"> <figcaption> Me with the view of the Dead Sea from Masada</figcaption> </figure> </p>

				
				<p> The driver then took us to Ein Gedi nature preserves where we saw a good variety of wildlife and a waterfall in a desert. The animal whose presence fascinated me the most was the mountain goat. It’s horn was majestic and made a sharp curve to the back of its head. The waterfall was very pretty and clean and the sound its continuous splash made was soothing. We met some more Americans and talked to them; my point is that, there are a lot more Americans visiting Israel than one may think. They took a picture of us with the MIT pose (the waterfall was the I because we were feeling artsy).

				<p> Our next stop was of course, the dead sea. Since I don’t know how to swim, I didn’t go into the sea. Nikhil and Meia went to take a “swim” but were oblivious of how muddy the shore was.  Just like most people who came after us, they would try so hard to walk further into the water before trying to float. This resulted in feet sinking deep into the mud, which seemed hilarious from outside. Eventually, everyone got the cue that they just had to let go and lie on their backs and they would invariably float. They floated magically like paper boats - effortlessly lying atop the very salty sea. Nikhil and Meia took the famous mud bath at the shore and then rinsed themselves afterwards. </p> 

				<p> We headed back to Jerusalem on the tour bus and then went back to Ein Shemer from there, ready to meet yet another week of fun and work! </p>
